      There are many considerations to consider when it comes to cyber security
      in a company. It will depend on whether the company's employees mostly
      work with PCs and how many employees the company has. <br /><br />

      If we start from the fact that the company mainly works with PCs and that
      there is a fair number of employees, the first security measure would be
      to run security training/courses in the form of simple introductory videos
      with questions for all employees that will be mandatory, so that the risk
      of phishing and other specific security threats is reduced. Make all
      employees in the company care about cyber security, not just the IT
      department. <br /><br />

      It will be very important to have good security systems and programs that
      limit the risk of the company being exposed to Cross-Site scripting, SQL
      injection, and Cross-Site request forgery. Good training and information
      in this area is very important. <br /><br />

      Good login with two-step login and routines for changing passwords is also
      important to avoid unnecessary threats to the system and employees. Strict
      rules for which programs can be installed on a work PC will reduce the
      risk of installing malware on employees' work PCs. Random samples of
      e-mails that simulate phishing attempts will make the employees more
      secure and aware in their everyday work. <br /><br />

      Those are only a small number of measures that can help a business with
      cybersecurity.
